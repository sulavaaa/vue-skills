Lets try to understand Components in vue
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Eg: lets look at App.vue inside src 

It has three main sections 
a. template
    html, vue directives and vue component wrappers go inside there

b. script
    logic of app resides
c. style 
    css is place here. 

How to import other Components
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    a. First we reference the name of the component as a custom element in template section
    b. In script section we use keyword import <nameoftheComponent> from '<pathoftheComponent>'
    c. also in the same section inside export default {} we reference component by its name
        export default {
            name: 'app',
            Components: {
                HelloWorld
            }
        }
Note: .vue represents single file component. Components have there home inside src/components

Vue templating : understanding Vue interpolation and vue directives. 

- The most basic form of vue interpolation is called text interpolation. 
- It is simply the process of displaying the text defined in your component logic. 

    Vue interpolation braces {{ }} : 
    - to show values of proptery in template section we need Mustaches (two swiggly braces) or interpolation braces. 
    - within those we put in name of the property. 

Interpolation in html attributes  
    - You can't use {{ }} within attributes. 

    v-on : is a vue directive.
