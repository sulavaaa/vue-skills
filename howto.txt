Lets try to understand Components in vue
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Eg: lets look at App.vue inside src 

It has three main sections 
a. template
    html, vue directives and vue component wrappers go inside there

b. script
    logic of app resides
c. style 
    css is place here. 

How to import other Components
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    a. First we reference the name of the component as a custom element in template section
    b. In script section we use keyword import <nameoftheComponent> from '<pathoftheComponent>'
    c. also in the same section inside export default {} we reference component by its name
        export default {
            name: 'app',
            Components: {
                HelloWorld
            }
        }
Note: .vue represents single file component. Components have there home inside src/components
